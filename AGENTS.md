# Obsidian Wiki — Agent Context

A **skill-based framework** for building and maintaining an Obsidian knowledge base. No scripts or dependencies — everything is markdown instructions that you execute directly.

## README Translation Parity

`README.md` and `README_TW.md` are one documentation surface. Keep headings, examples, links, and user-facing behavior aligned between the two translations. The check is advisory and never blocks a PR: the `readme-translation-drift` CI job only reports drift. Run `python tools/check_readme_sync.py` to list commits that changed `README.md` without a later `README_TW.md` update, along with the pending English diff — then translate and backfill those changes into `README_TW.md`. Reviewers assess translation quality.

## Configuration

Resolve config using the Config Resolution Protocol in `llm-wiki/SKILL.md`:

0. **Inline vault override (`@name`)** — if the request contains an `@<name>` token, resolve `~/.obsidian-wiki/config.<name>` directly, overriding the steps below. See "Targeting a specific vault" right after this list.
1. **Walk up from CWD** — look for a `.env` file in the current directory, then each parent, up to `$HOME`. Stop at the first `.env` that contains `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`.
2. **Global config** — if no local `.env` is found, read `~/.obsidian-wiki/config`.
3. **Prompt setup** — if neither exists, tell the user to run `wiki-setup`.

The resolved config sets `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` (where the wiki lives). It may also set `OBSIDIAN_WIKI_REPO` (where this repo is cloned) and other optional variables.

### Targeting a specific vault

You can maintain multiple vaults (each a `~/.obsidian-wiki/config.<name>` file managed by `wiki-switch`) and reach any of them from any directory:

- **`@name` (per-invocation override)** — prefix or mention `@<name>` anywhere in a request to route that one command to that vault, e.g. `@work save this` or `wiki-query @personal what do I know about X`. It overrides the CWD `.env` and the active symlink **for that invocation only** — it does **not** flip your default vault. If `config.<name>` doesn't exist, the skill reports it and lists available vaults; do **not** silently fall back to the default. The `@name` is stripped before the rest of the request is used as content.
- **`/wiki-switch <name>` (persistent default)** — re-points the active symlink so all future requests use that vault. This is your default "brain" vault; use `@name` to dip into the other one without switching.

**After reading config, always read `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/AGENTS.md` if it exists.** It contains owner-specific conventions (domain vocabulary, ingest preferences, writing style, project scoping) that override framework defaults for all skills. Apply it for the duration of the session.

## Knowledge Packs

Each initialized vault binds one Knowledge Pack selected during setup. A Pack contains a semantic
`profile.json` and a physical Vault Layout. The Knowledge Profile defines purpose, scope,
knowledge types, extraction retain/omit policy, verification, freshness, and retrieval priorities;
the Layout defines content roots, system areas, and page-type-to-path routing. The current release
ships them one-to-one under `workflows/layouts/<name>/`, and the CLI retains the `--layout` name.

Do not perform per-source domain detection or switch Packs during ingest. Load the Profile frozen
under `wiki-context.json.optional_metadata.active_layout.knowledge_profile`, check source
compatibility, and execute its `scope.on_mismatch` action. `@name` is a Named Vault Profile used to
select config/vault; it is unrelated to the Knowledge Profile. `WRITING.md` is likewise only a
Writing Profile.

## Vault Structure

The tree below is the `default` Knowledge Pack example. Other Packs declare different content
roots through their Vault Layout; workflows must use the active routing contract rather than these
directory names.

```
$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/
├── index.md                # Master index — every page listed, always kept current
├── log.md                  # Chronological activity log (ingests, updates, lints)
├── hot.md                  # Session hot cache — ~500-word semantic snapshot of recent activity
├── .manifest.json          # Tracks every ingested source: path, timestamps, pages produced
├── _meta/
│   ├── taxonomy.md         # Controlled tag vocabulary
│   ├── ingest-jobs/        # Durable V1 text-ingest Jobs and Packets
│   └── *.base              # Obsidian Bases dashboard definitions (wiki-dashboard skill)
├── _insights.md            # Graph analysis output (hubs, bridges, dead ends)
├── _raw/                   # Staging area — drop rough notes here, next ingest promotes them
├── _readouts/              # Derived narrative readouts saved by wiki-narrate — not knowledge pages
├── concepts/               # Abstract ideas, patterns, mental models

└── projects/
    └── <project-name>.md   # One page per project synced via wiki-update
```

Every wiki page has required frontmatter: `title`, `category`, `tags`, `sources`, `created`, `updated`. Pages connect via internal links — `[[wikilinks]]` by default, or standard Markdown links when `OBSIDIAN_LINK_FORMAT=markdown` is set in config.

## Skill Routing

Skills live in `.skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Match the user's intent to the right skill:

| User says something like… | Skill |
|---|---|

| "ingest this folder" / "process these text docs" / a local `.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdx`, `.txt`, or `.rst` source | `wiki-folder-ingest` |
| One planned text range assigned by an ingest Job | `wiki-source-text` |
| One coordinator-assigned Packet transaction | `wiki-packet-integrate` (worker-only) |
| PDF, Office, structured data, logs/transcripts, HTML/URLs, media, archives, or source code | Explicitly unsupported by text ingest V1; use a dedicated skill when one exists |

### Session history: ingest vs. retrieve

Three skills read agent session caches, and they are not interchangeable:

- `wiki-history-ingest` (and its per-agent variants) **ingests** — distils sessions into permanent vault pages.
- `wiki-agent` **ingests a slice** — finds sessions about one topic in another agent's history and pulls them into the vault.
- `session-brain` / `session-search` **retrieve** — build a topic graph over the raw sessions and find or load one. They write a sidecar at `~/.claude/session-brain/` and never touch the vault.

If the user wants knowledge preserved, ingest. If they want to find the session where something happened, retrieve.

## Cross-Project Usage

The main use case: you're working in some other project and want to sync knowledge into your wiki, query it, or compile bounded context. Three portable skills handle this — `wiki-update`, `wiki-query`, and `wiki-context-pack`. They work from any directory.

### wiki-update (write to wiki)

1. Resolve config using the Config Resolution Protocol to get `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`
2. Scan the current project: README, source structure, git log, package metadata
3. Distill what's worth remembering (architecture decisions, patterns, trade-offs — not code listings)
4. Write to `$VAULT/projects/<project-name>.md`, cross-linking to concept/entity pages as needed
5. Update `.manifest.json`, `index.md`, and `log.md`

On repeat runs, it checks `last_commit_synced` in `.manifest.json` and only processes the delta via `git log <last_commit>..HEAD`.

### wiki-query (read from wiki)

1. Resolve config using the Config Resolution Protocol to get `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`
2. Scan titles, tags, and `summary:` frontmatter fields first (cheap pass)
3. Only open page bodies when the index pass can't answer
4. Return a synthesized answer with `[[wikilink]]` citations

### wiki-context-pack (read-only context)

1. Resolve the target vault and read its owner `AGENTS.md`
2. Rank existing notes without requiring schema migration
3. Compile summaries and selected excerpts within a hard token budget
4. Return a provenance-rich pack; never write it back to the vault

## Visibility Tags (optional)

Pages can carry a `visibility/` tag to mark their intended reach. **This is entirely optional** — untagged pages behave exactly as they always have (visible everywhere). The system stays single-vault, single source of truth.

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *(no tag)* | Same as `visibility/public` — visible in all modes |
| `visibility/public` | Explicitly public — visible in all modes |
| `visibility/internal` | Team-only — excluded when querying in filtered mode |
| `visibility/pii` | Sensitive data — excluded when querying in filtered mode |

**Filtered mode** is opt-in, triggered by phrases like "public only", "user-facing answer", "no internal content", or "as a user would see it" in a query. Default mode shows everything.

`visibility/` tags are **system tags** — they don't count toward the 5-tag limit and are listed separately from domain/type tags in the taxonomy.

See `wiki-query` and `wiki-export` skills for how the filter is applied.

## Core Principles

- **Compile, don't retrieve.** The wiki is pre-compiled knowledge. Update existing pages — don't append or duplicate.
- **Track everything.** Update `.manifest.json` after ingesting, `index.md`, `log.md`, and `hot.md` after any write operation.
- **Connect with `[[wikilinks]]`.** Every page should link to related pages. This is what makes it a knowledge graph, not a folder of files.
- **Frontmatter is required.** Every wiki page needs: `title`, `category`, `tags`, `sources`, `created`, `updated`.
- **Single source of truth.** Visibility tags shape how content is surfaced — they don't duplicate or separate it.
- **Keep context warm.** `hot.md` is a ~500-word semantic snapshot of recent activity. Every write skill updates it so the next session can pick up where the last one left off without crawling the full vault.

## Architecture Reference

For the full pattern (three-layer architecture, page templates, project org), read `.skills/llm-wiki/SKILL.md`.

Human-facing documentation lives in `docs/` — `installation.md`, `agents.md`, `skills.md`, `cli.md`, `configuration.md`, `architecture.md`, `session-brain.md`, `contributing.md`. `README.md` is a landing page only; when you add a skill, CLI command, or config variable, update the matching `docs/` page rather than the README.

The vault format is structurally conformant with the [Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.1](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md) — markdown files with YAML frontmatter, category subfolders, reserved `index.md`/`log.md`. `wiki-export` (OKF mode) and `wiki-import` are the bridge: they translate between our native frontmatter (`title`/`category`/`tags`/`sources`/`created`/`updated` + `summary`) and OKF (`type`/`title`/`description`/`resource`/`tags`/`timestamp`), making vaults exchangeable with any OKF tool. The OKF round-trip is lossless; the `graph.json` round-trip is not.
